## Description for ML Disease Prediction: 
  This dataset seems to be related to predicting the likelihood of an individual developing a disease (likely cardiovascular) based on various risk factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes, family history, and exercise level.

In a machine learning context, this would be a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether an individual has a disease or not (represented by the "Disease" column) based on the input features (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.).

- **Features (Input Variables):** Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate, Smoking Status, Diabetes, Family History, Exercise Level.

- **Target (Output Variable):** Disease (either 0 for no disease or 1 for having the disease).

### Column Descriptions:
  - **Age:** Represents the age of the individual in years. Age is often a critical factor in disease prediction as certain diseases (like cardiovascular conditions) become more prevalent with age.
  - **Blood Pressure:** The blood pressure value (likely systolic blood pressure) of the individual, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). High blood pressure is a known risk factor for heart diseases and other health issues.
  - **Cholesterol:** The total cholesterol level of the individual, typically measured in mg/dL. Elevated cholesterol levels can lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of heart diseases.
  - **Heart Rate:** The resting heart rate of the individual, usually measured in beats per minute (BPM). Heart rate can reflect cardiovascular health, where higher or lower than normal rates might indicate underlying health issues.
  - **Smoking Status:** Indicates whether the individual smokes or not.
      0 = Non-smoker
      1 = Smoker
      Smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
  - **Diabetes:** Indicates whether the individual has diabetes or not.
      0 = No diabetes
      1 = Has diabetes
      Diabetes is a significant factor in predicting various diseases, particularly heart disease and stroke.
  - **Family History:** Indicates whether the individual has a family history of diseases (likely related to heart diseases or other genetic conditions).
      0 = No family history of disease
      1 = Has a family history of disease
      Family history can increase the likelihood of developing certain conditions.
  - **Exercise Level:** Describes the individual's level of physical activity.
      Low = Low physical activity
      High = High physical activity
      Regular exercise is known to reduce the risk of many diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases.
  - **Disease:** The target variable indicating whether the individual has a disease (likely cardiovascular disease in this context).
      0 = No disease
      1 = Has disease
